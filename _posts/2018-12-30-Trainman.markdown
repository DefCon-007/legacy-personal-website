Trainman helps you to find alternate train bookings on the same route and train for Indian railways. 

You can check it out at <http://trainman.defcon007.com/>. 

Github - <https://github.com/DefCon-007/trainman>.

## How it works
Let's say your train starts at source station A and ends at destination startion F and follows the following path:

A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F

Now you want to travel from B to D, but there is no ticket available. Indian trains have ticket quotas on the basis of stations. So, even if tickets from B to D are fully booked, you may get a reservation from any of the following routes in the same train :

A->D
A->E
A->F
.
.
.

TrainMan lists availabitily on these kind of alternate routes to make your journey hassel free.
