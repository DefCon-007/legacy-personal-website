Utilo is a one stop solution to a number of problems we face in day to day life. For example, Downloading a youtube video, being up to date with a facebook page or twitter handle etc. Utilo uses telegram to communicate with the users. It is a Utility bot which works on telegram. Utilo has a lot of useful functions : 

1. File URL generator
2. Youtube download and search 
3. Facebook and twitter subscription 
4. If you want to send someone an E-mail without using your E-mail id Utilo can help you in that too. 
5. If you feel bored Utilo can also entertain you with hilarious random Chuck Norris jokes.

**This project also won 3rd place in DigitalOcean CloudHack's online edition !**
