<p>Hi! I am Ayush Goyal, currently working as a Software Engineer at <a href='https://www.rippling.com' target="_blank">Rippling</a> and an alumni of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iitkgp.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</a>, India graduated with B.Tech (Hons) from the department of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.agri.iitkgp.ernet.in">Agricultural and Food Engineering</a> in 2019.</p>
